  <h1 class="text-2xl lg:text-4xl font-medium leading-normal mb-12 lg:mb-24">Joel Hans is a fiction author, editor, and developer relations lead in Tucson, Arizona.</h1>
  <p class="text-xl lg:text-2xl mb-12">His debut short story collection, <span class="italic [font-variant:small-caps]">The Bedtime Emptying of Our World</span>, won the 2024 Moon City Short Fiction award and will be published in late 2025 with Moon City Press. These twenty-two fairy-tale and fabulist stories reckon with the trials of parenthoood, loss, impossible quests, helpers, and tiny lacks that, in ways beyond our understanding, become voids that encompass us all.</p>
  <img class="" alt="" src="/collection.png" />
  <p class="text-xl lg:text-2xl">His fiction has been published in <em>Fairy Tale Review</em>, <em>Story</em>, <em>West Branch</em>, <em>Booth: A Journal</em>, <em>Passages North</em>, <em>HAD</em>, and many others, and has been anthologized in <em>Best Small Fictions</em>. He received his MFA from the University of Arizona, and now edits <a href="https://astrolabe.ooo"><em>Astrolabe</em></a>, a literary journal in the form of a dynamic universe.</p>
