I recently did a short reading of of "The Times I'll Trade Time with the Crows," which was selected for [*Best Small Fictions* 2024](https://altcurrentpress.com/2025/01/22/best-small-fictions-2024/), as part of National Flash Fiction Day.

I hadn't read my work in more than two years, so this was a much-needed reintroduction to the public side of writing, to a different medium, to some level of comfort with the often strange sounds of my prose (especially here). This story definitely pushed my limits—odd contractions like *I’ll've* and *sister'll* will do that—but I'm really happy with how the whole reading turned out.

My section starts at 15:50, but I encourage you to check out the whole reading&mdash;beginning to end, this was an incredible group.

You can also find the published version of this story on [*Atlas and Alice*](https://atlasandalice.com/2023/01/30/fiction-from-joel-hans/). Or, if you're the mildly patient and *prefer-in-print* type, you can always wait for my [forthcoming short story collection](/blog/a-book), where this story will also soon appear.

Thanks to Myna Chang for giving me the opportunity!
